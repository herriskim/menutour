# Recommendation from PMO

The project owner has no IT resources and is a non-expert in information technology. In view of this, PMO submits the following recommendation report.

1. The pilot program source is transferred to GitHub, preserved safely, and prepared for future advancement projects. 

2. It is recommended that the user manual for introducing and guiding the pilot system to investors and users be prepared in GitBook to maintain consistency with GitHub. 

3. It is very unfortunate that SV GROUP did not prepare various outputs that should have been written. Even if it is not possible to complete all of them, the contract must be closed after receiving the following minimal outputs.

* [ ] Architecture Design Document
* [ ] Entity Relationship Diagram 
* [ ] User's Manual 
* [ ] System Admin. Manual

4. When the contract is terminated, a one-year warranty for defect repair is required, and a time limit for troubleshooting must be specified.
