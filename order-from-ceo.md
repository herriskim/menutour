# Order from CEO

This project has been promoted by Mr. Jung for 5-6 years and is expected to launch a pilot system in September 2020. Currently, this system is being developed through SV GROUP, an outsourcing company, from September 2019, but there are some problems. So Mr. Jung wants to solve this problem by temporarily hiring a PMO, and on August 27, 2020, he decided to hire HS KIM. The issues to be solved are as follows: 

1. Check the PILOT system to derive the problems 

2. Obtain the documents filed by the developing company

3. Configure the architecture to be operated systems  

4. Propose the planning for completing this PILOT system to the level required by the CEO
